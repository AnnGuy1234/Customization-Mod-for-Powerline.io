# IMPORTANT AWARENESS
some scripts unfortunately contain code that can take your personal information or data. Watch out for that. DON'T COME COMPLAINING THERE IS A VIRUS IT IS OPENSOURCE. This script does not contain any sort of virus or anything the code is available in entire.js(https://github.com/LightLordYT/Modded-UI-for-Slither.io/blob/main/entire.js) anyway. 

# Installation
I don't think it even works if you paste this code into the console(inspect element) and it is unnecessary anyway since tampermonkey is a code executor extension. So basically copy paste code into new tampermonkey script(delete current code in the new script first) and press file save. GO TO https://github.com/LightLordYT/Modded-UI-for-Slither.io/blob/main/ui.js COPY THE CODE AND PASTE INTO NEW TAMPERMONKEY SCRIPT MAKE SURE THE CODE IN NEW SCRIPT IS FIRST DELETED BEFORE PASTING NEW SCRIPT MAKE SURE TO GO TO THE TAMPERMONKEY DASHBOARD AND TURN THE SCRIPT ON. THEN REFRESH SLITHER.IO

# Contact Information
If you want to ask any questions or collab on a coding project you can reach me through github,discord, or greasyfork. Please don't contact me with unnecessary stuff Discord: LightLord#4261 GreasyFork: https://greasyfork.org/en/users/798398-lightlord DON'T SPAM ME ABOUT HOW THIS IS A VIRUS READ ABOVE!!!

# Contribution
Help is always appreciated. If you want to help, want a feature, or found a problem, open an issue(https://github.com/LightLordYT/Modded-UI-Slither.io/issues).

# Updates
When I push out new updates tampermonkey should detect it and ask if you want to update it. If not just look at github or greasyfork to see if there are new updates I will have version history available so you can see what I did for each new update. The big number 1.0.0 the one is the big number. ---\ If the big number is changed that means that it is a really big update like new features or something. The first zero the one closest to one stands for medium updates Medium updates are like adding one feature and fixing or improving a feature or something. The last zero the one farthest for the one is small updates. Small updates are like fixing bugs and glitches here and there basically you won't notice a big difference if you use for example 1.0.1 and 1.0.0
